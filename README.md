### Short intro

Terraform and Ansible are both popular tools for infrastructure automation. Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to declare infrastructure as code and manage it in a versioned way. It uses a configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define resources and provision them in a cloud environment. Terraform supports many cloud providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. This makes it possible to manage your infrastructure in a consistent way, no matter which provider you use.

Ansible, on the other hand, is a tool for automating the deployment and configuration of software. It uses a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, called YAML, to describe the desired state of your infrastructure. Ansible also has a large library of pre-written modules for common tasks, such as installing packages, copying files, and creating users. This makes it easy to automate routine tasks, and reduces the amount of time required to deploy applications. Ansible also integrates well with Terraform, making it possible to use both tools together to automate the full life cycle of your infrastructure.

In conclusion, Terraform and Ansible are both powerful tools for infrastructure automation. Terraform is used to manage infrastructure as code, while Ansible is used to automate the deployment and configuration of software. The two tools complement each other well, making it possible to automate the full life cycle of your infrastructure in a consistent and efficient way.
